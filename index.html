<h1> Welcome to Nick's Programming Portfolio </h1>
<p>
    Hello, my name is Nickolas Psikakos and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Rhode Island. 
    I will be uploading my CSC 106 assignments to this page and will build upon it as we move forward in the class.
    I'm thankful and excited to have the oppurtunity to take this class, and being able to develop new things using HTML and Javascript!
